# Biography

I am a biomedical engineering PhD student advised by Dr. Young Hwan Chang in the Computational Biology Program at Oregon Health & Science University. My research focuses on deep learning applications for medical imaging, in particular, the application of generative models to learn crosswise mappings between imaging modalities (see our <a href="files/SHIFT-SPIE-Medical-Imaging-2018.pdf" target="\_blank">SHIFT paper</a> for the details). View my <a href="files/cv.pdf" target="\_blank">CV</a> for a more complete story.
