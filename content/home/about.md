# Biography

Erik Ames Burlingame is a neuroscience PhD student at OHSU with a background in machine/deep learning applications in medical imaging, in particular, the application of generative adversarial networks to translate images from one imaging modality into another (see our <a href="files/SHIFT-SPIE-Medical-Imaging-2018.pdf" target="\_blank">SHIFT paper</a> for the details). As a neuroscience student, he is interested in leveraging his knowledge of machine/deep learning technology to potentiate my research on the structural biology of the nervous system, which will focus on ion channel/GPCR structure and function.
